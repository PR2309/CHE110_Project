        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Grasslands are vast open spaces that are dominated by grasses and have few trees. They cover approximately one-quarter of the Earth's land surface and can be found on every continent except Antarctica. </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="climate">
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>The climate of grasslands is typically characterized by hot summers and cold winters, with an annual rainfall between 10 and 30 inches. The soils are deep and rich in nutrients, making them ideal for growing grasses.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="flora">
        <h2>Flora</h2>
        <p>The grasses in a grassland ecosystem are typically divided into two categories: short grasses and tall grasses. Short grasses include buffalo grass, blue grama, and western wheatgrass, while tall grasses include big bluestem, Indian grass, and switchgrass. In addition to grasses, many types of wildflowers, herbs, and shrubs also grow in grasslands.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="fauna">
        <h2>Fauna</h2>
        <p>Grasslands support a diverse array of wildlife, including large grazing animals like bison, elk, and pronghorn antelope. Smaller mammals like prairie dogs and ground squirrels also make their homes in grasslands. Birds like meadowlarks, prairie chickens, and hawks are common, and many types of insects thrive in grasslands as well.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="human-impact">
        <h2>Human Impact</h2>
        <p>Human activities have had a significant impact on grasslands. Conversion of grasslands to agricultural land has led to the loss of native grasses and the decline of many species that depend on them. Overgrazing by livestock has also been a major issue, leading to soil erosion and the degradation of grasslands.</p>
