      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Urban ecosystems are complex and diverse environments that exist in and around cities. They can include everything from parks and gardens to the buildings and streets themselves. While urbanization can have negative impacts on the environment, urban ecosystems also provide important benefits to human health and well-being.</p>

      <h2>Urban Parks</h2>
      <p>Urban parks are important components of urban ecosystems, providing green spaces for recreation and relaxation. They can also serve as habitats for a variety of plant and animal species, including birds and insects. Many cities are working to expand and improve their park systems in order to provide more green space and improve the health of their residents.</p>

      <h2>Green Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>Green infrastructure refers to the natural and semi-natural systems that help to manage stormwater, reduce air pollution, and provide other environmental benefits in urban areas. This can include things like green roofs, rain gardens, and urban forests. Green infrastructure is becoming increasingly important as cities look for ways to become more sustainable and resilient.</p>

      <h2>Wildlife in the City</h2>
      <p>Despite the concrete and steel of urban areas, many species of wildlife can still be found in cities. Birds, squirrels, and other small mammals are common sights, and some cities even have populations of larger animals like coyotes and deer. Urban wildlife can provide important ecosystem services, such as pollination and pest control.</p>

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Urban ecosystems face a number of challenges, including pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. Cities must work to manage their resources sustainably and protect the health of their residents and the environment. This can involve everything from reducing energy use and promoting public transportation to creating green spaces and protecting wildlife habitat.</p>
