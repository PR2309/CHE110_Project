            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Marine ecosystems are the largest and most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They cover more than 70% of the planet's surface and contain an incredible variety of plant and animal life. Marine ecosystems are also important sources of food, recreation, and other resources for humans.</p>

            <h2>Ocean Zones</h2>
            <p>The ocean can be divided into several zones based on depth and distance from shore. The intertidal zone is the area between high and low tide, and is home to a variety of plants and animals that can survive both in and out of the water. The pelagic zone is the open ocean, where large fish, whales, and other sea creatures live. The benthic zone is the ocean floor, where creatures like starfish, clams, and crabs can be found. The deep sea is the area beyond the continental shelf, where unique creatures like giant squid and anglerfish live in complete darkness.</p>

            <h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
            <p>Marine ecosystems are home to a wide variety of plant and animal life. Phytoplankton, which are microscopic algae, are the basis of the ocean food chain and are responsible for producing most of the oxygen we breathe. Other important marine plants include seagrass, kelp, and mangroves. Marine animals range from tiny plankton to massive whales, and include fish, sharks, dolphins, sea turtles, and many others.</p>

            <h2>Human Impact</h2>
            <p>Human activities have had a significant impact on marine ecosystems. Pollution, overfishing, and climate change are all major threats to the health of the ocean. Plastic pollution is a particular problem, as it can harm marine life and enter the food chain. Overfishing can lead to the depletion of fish populations, which can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Climate change is also causing ocean temperatures to rise, which can lead to the bleaching of coral reefs and the loss of biodiversity.</p>
