            <h2>Clean Air and Water</h2>
            <p>Our ecosystem plays a crucial role in maintaining clean air and water. Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to regulate atmospheric composition. Wetlands and other ecosystems help filter pollutants from water, improving its quality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Climate Regulation</h2>
            <p>Our ecosystem helps regulate the Earth's climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This helps to mitigate the impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures and sea levels.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Nutrient Cycling</h2>
            <p>Our ecosystem plays a crucial role in the cycling of nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. This helps to maintain soil fertility and support the growth of plants and other organisms.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>Our ecosystem supports a wide range of plant and animal species, contributing to the diversity of life on Earth. Biodiversity is important for maintaining ecosystem health and stability, as well as providing important resources for human use.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Recreational Opportunities</h2>
            <p>Our ecosystem provides a range of recreational opportunities, such as hiking, camping, fishing, and wildlife watching. These activities can have important benefits for human health and well-being, as well as providing economic benefits through tourism and recreation.</p>
